CHECKS TO MAKE/THINGS TO LOOK INTO:

- Look into leagues that with missing data from the Matchup Data and leagues with 
missing data from the Projected Points data 
    a) None of the leagues in the Matchup data have week 17 data and only a few 
    hundred have week 16 data. This shouldn't be an issue since we only need data 
    from the first week of playoffs (which should be week 15 at the latest), but 
    it is a little odd.
    a) Only ~60 leagues in the Matchup data have missing data for weeks 1-15
- Check that the scores from the Matchup and Projected data match
