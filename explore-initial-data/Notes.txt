CHECKS TO MAKE/THINGS TO LOOK INTO:

- Look into leagues that with missing data from the Matchup Data and leagues with 
missing data from the Projected Points data 
    a) None of the leagues in the Matchup data have week 17 data and only a few 
    hundred have week 16 data. This shouldn't be an issue since we only need data 
    from the first week of playoffs (which should be week 15 at the latest), but 
    it is a little odd.
    a) Only ~60 leagues in the Matchup data have missing data for weeks 1-15
- Check that the scores from the Matchup and Projected data match
    a) ID leagues that never have any differences
    b) check overall average difference by week

- Things to filter out:
    a) Leagues that don't have an entire regular season of data (need at least
    one playoff week)
        1. Note: These leagues wouldn't impact the forecasting model, but they would
        make it more difficult to evaluate the simulation results
    b) Leagues with any Team/Week that is missing data
    c) Leagues with any non-consecutive weeks
    
- Metric to include in the projected point aggregation
    a) Starter actual and projected points
    b) Bench actual and projected points
    c) Max projectd points
        1. THIS WILL REQUIRE LOOKING AND PULLING THE FOLLOWING DATA:
            - Flex eligbility
            - Actual position for bench players rather than just "bench"
        2. Need to consider scenario where no rostered player is projected for
        any points (e.g. fill in with average for that position?). This likely
        won't show up in the data since it represents what the rosters actually
        were for each week (i.e. teams already made replacements), but could occur
        if it gets used in the middle of the week
